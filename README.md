ThumbViewGen
============

Thumbnail View Generator

Generate an html page with 'executable > mypage.html' on the commandline to view all subfolder images in a page, or thumbnails... depending on which file you execute.  Or try the TKinter viewer for images in your thumbnails folder.

NOTE: These are primarily *nix specific, and not for Windows.
